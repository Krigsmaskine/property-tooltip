# Property Tooltip

Property Tooltip provides tooltips for (currently) weapon properties in dnd5e. When editing the weapon, you will see tooltips when hovering over the different properties.

(insert picture here lmao)

The default tooltips are defined by a journalEntry in a compendium named Property Tooltip that comes with the module. If you want to change or add to them, please read the Instructions page in said journalEntry.
