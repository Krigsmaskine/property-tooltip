# Property Tooltip

Property Tooltip provides tooltips for (currently) weapon properties in dnd5e. When editing the weapon, you will see tooltips when hovering over the different properties.

The default tooltips are defined by a journalEntry in a compendium named Property Tooltip that comes with the module. If you want to change or add to them, please read the Instructions page in said journalEntry.

## Changelog

### 1.0
Initial release.

## Thanks to
Foundry's community. Particular thanks to those in #module-development on the Discord. If you ever doubt you could develop a module, I suggest giving it a shot and asking for help if stuck. I have yet to regret it.
